{"predictions":[{"prompt":"Generate an article about quantum physics:","output":["Quantum mechanics is a branch of theoretical physics that deals with the theory of quantum mechanics. The term \"quantum mechanics\" was first coined by Albert Einstein in 1905, and it has been used since then to describe many different types of physical phenomena such as electromagnetism, magnetism, superconductivity, thermodynamics, gravitational waves, etc. It can be divided into four main branches: (i) classical mechanics; (ii) non-commutative mechanics; (iii) macroscopic mechanics; and (iv) relativistic mechanics. Non-commutative mechanics refers to any kind of mechanical force acting on an object at one particular point in time. Examples of non-commutative mechanics are piezoelectricity, molecular mechanics, fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, plasma mechanics, vacuum mechanics,"],"parameters":{}}]}
